# Configuration

OpenConnector is configured with environment variables.

| Variable                                 | Default                   | Purpose                                                                        |

| `OOMOL_CONNECT_JWT_AUDIENCE`             | unset                     | Expected API `aud` claim for runtime JWT access tokens.                        |

Example:

```bash
OOMOL_CONNECT_DATA_DIR="$PWD/data" \
OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY="replace-with-a-long-random-secret" \
OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN="replace-with-an-admin-token" \
OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOWED_ACTIONS="hackernews.*,github.get_current_user" \
OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOWED_PROXIES="github" \
npm run dev
```

Create persistent runtime tokens from the web console Access tab or `POST /api/runtime-tokens`.
Only token hashes are stored: the Node server stores persistent-token records in SQLite, while
Cloudflare Workers store them in D1. Persistent tokens have independent Action rules and provider
proxy grants. A new token has no proxy access until its `allowedProxies` includes a provider service
or `*`; those grants can only narrow the deployment and runtime proxy policy.
`OOMOL_CONNECT_RUNTIME_TOKEN` remains available for bootstrap scripts and backward compatibility.
Because the bootstrap token has no stored policy, its proxy access is controlled only by the
deployment and runtime proxy rules.

## Sayna voice chat

Docker deployments include [Sayna](https://github.com/SaynaAI/sayna) in the Open Connector image and
launch both runtimes inside one container. Open **Chat**, choose **Set up voice**, and enter an
ElevenLabs API key and optional voice ID. Open Connector saves the key in its credential store,
injects it into each server-side Sayna session, and never returns it to the browser. Set
`OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to encrypt stored credentials at rest.

Sayna uses ElevenLabs Scribe v2 Realtime for microphone transcription and ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 for
spoken replies. Its model and audio cache lives under the existing `/app/data` volume, so no second
service or volume is required.

Set `OOMOL_CONNECT_SAYNA_URL` directly when Sayna is already deployed. HTTP and HTTPS origins are
accepted and normalized to WebSocket URLs; a root origin automatically receives the `/ws` path.
Public Sayna endpoints work with the default egress policy. Private endpoints require
`OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true` and remain subject to the guarded WebSocket SSRF policy.

Chat receives linear 16-bit PCM from Sayna and schedules the streamed audio frames directly through
the browser audio context. Cloudflare deployments do not expose this Node-only WebSocket bridge.

## JWT access tokens

The Node server can validate JWT access tokens issued by an existing identity provider for `/v1/*`
and `/mcp`. Configure all three settings together:

```bash
OOMOL_CONNECT_JWKS_URI="https://idp.example.com/oauth2/jwks" \
OOMOL_CONNECT_JWT_ISSUER="https://idp.example.com" \
OOMOL_CONNECT_JWT_AUDIENCE="https://connect-api.example.com" \
npm run dev
```

`OOMOL_CONNECT_JWKS_URI` must be the direct HTTPS JWKS endpoint, not an OIDC discovery URL. Plain
HTTP is accepted only for loopback endpoints used during local development. `OOMOL_CONNECT_JWT_AUDIENCE`
should identify this API resource, not a web application's OIDC client. OpenConnector requires an
expiration claim and validates the JWT signature, issuer, audience, expiration, and not-before time.
Clients send the access token as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.

JWT authentication is additive: the bootstrap runtime token and persistent `oct_...` tokens remain
valid when JWT verification is configured. For a JWT-only deployment, leave
`OOMOL_CONNECT_RUNTIME_TOKEN` unset and revoke any persistent runtime tokens. JWTs do not grant
access to the admin API, docs, or web console, so configure `OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN` separately
before exposing those surfaces.

OpenConnector acts only as a resource server. It does not implement OIDC discovery or login, accept
ID tokens as API credentials, or map JWT claims to action and proxy policy. JWT verification is
currently available only on the Node server, not Cloudflare Workers.

## Private network access

By default OpenConnector applies a public-only SSRF guard to every user-supplied
URL, including self-hosted provider instance URLs (for example the Dokploy
**Instance URL** or Obsidian **Server URL**). Connections may therefore only
target public addresses, and private targets are rejected during connection
setup.

Some self-hosted services are only reachable over a LAN or an overlay network
such as Tailscale or NetBird. To allow those connections, set
`OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true`. When enabled, provider connections
that explicitly opt in, including **Dokploy** and **Obsidian**, may target:

- RFC 1918 ranges: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
- Carrier-grade NAT / shared address space `100.64.0.0/10` (Tailscale, NetBird)
- Private hostname suffixes: `.local`, `.internal`, `.home`, `.lan`

The following targets stay blocked even when the flag is enabled:

- Loopback and localhost (`127.0.0.0/8`, `localhost`, `.localhost`)
- Link-local and cloud metadata (`169.254.0.0/16`, `100.100.100.200/32`, and
  metadata hostnames such as `metadata.google.internal`)
- Reserved, multicast, and broadcast ranges, and all IPv6 targets

> **Enable this only on a single-tenant, self-hosted runtime that you operate.**
> On a shared or multi-tenant deployment, turning it on lets any connection
> owner reach the operator's internal network from the runtime's egress
> position, so leave it at the `false` default there.

## Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare uses the same environment variable names for origin, static auth tokens, execution
policy, transit file limits, and data encryption. The JWT settings above, `PORT`, `HOST`, and
`OOMOL_CONNECT_DATA_DIR` are Node-only settings.

The Worker runtime also requires these bindings in `wrangler.local.jsonc`. Copy
`wrangler.example.jsonc` to `wrangler.local.jsonc` and fill in your own Cloudflare resource IDs
before running Wrangler commands.

- `DB`: D1 database for connections, OAuth config/state, runtime tokens, run logs, and idempotency
  claims and responses.
- `TRANSIT_FILES`: R2 bucket or Workers KV namespace for temporary transit files.
- `ASSETS`: Workers Static Assets binding for the web console.

R2 is the default transit-file backend. To use Workers KV, bind the KV namespace as
`TRANSIT_FILES` and set the Wrangler variable `TRANSIT_FILES_BACKEND` to `"kv"`. Configure exactly
one R2 bucket or KV namespace with that binding name. KV limits each file to 25 MiB, clamps the
transit-file TTL to a minimum of 60 seconds, and deletes expired files automatically.

Set secrets with Wrangler instead of committing them to config:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN --config wrangler.local.jsonc
npx wrangler secret put OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY --config wrangler.local.jsonc
```
