# Docker Image (GHCR)

OpenConnector ships a prebuilt Docker image on the GitHub Packages container registry (GHCR), so you
can run it without cloning the repository or building anything. The image is:

```text
ghcr.io/oomol-lab/open-connector
```

## Choose A Tag

| Tag           | Points at                            | Use it when                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest`      | the newest published release         | you want the current stable runtime                            |
| `v1.0.0`      | a specific release (immutable)       | you deploy to production and want a pinned, reproducible build |
| `tip`         | the latest commit on `main`          | you want to try changes that are not released yet              |
| `<short-sha>` | a specific `main` commit (immutable) | you want to pin an exact pre-release build                     |

For production, pin a released version such as `v1.0.0`.

## Pull

The image is public, so no sign-in is required:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/oomol-lab/open-connector:latest
```

If you get an `unauthorized` or `denied` error, sign in with a GitHub token that has the
`read:packages` scope:

```bash
echo "$GITHUB_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin
```

The image is multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`), so Docker automatically pulls the variant
that matches your machine — running natively on Intel/AMD hosts and on arm64 hosts such as Apple
Silicon and AWS Graviton. No `--platform` flag is needed.

## Run

The image listens on port `3000`, binds to `0.0.0.0`, and stores runtime data in `/app/data`.

First generate the runtime secrets and save them somewhere safe. `OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
encrypts stored credentials, OAuth client configuration, and completed idempotent Action responses;
if it is lost, the encrypted data in `/app/data` cannot be recovered.
`OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN` authenticates the admin API and console.

```bash
# Save both values in a password manager or secrets vault before running.
export OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

Then run the image, mounting a volume so data survives restarts:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name open-connector \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v open_connector_data:/app/data \
  -e OOMOL_CONNECT_ORIGIN="https://api.example.com" \
  -e OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$OOMOL_CONNECT_ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
  -e OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN="$OOMOL_CONNECT_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  ghcr.io/oomol-lab/open-connector:latest
```

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the full environment variable reference and
[credentials.md](credentials.md) for connecting providers.

### Connect An OpenAI Codex Subscription

The image includes the Codex CLI. Sign in with the ChatGPT account whose subscription should run
Chat and Flows, then verify the login from the console's **Agents** page:

```bash
docker exec -it open-connector codex login --device-auth
# Docker Compose: docker compose exec connector codex login --device-auth
```

Codex stores its login under `/app/data/codex`, so the mounted data volume preserves it across
container restarts. Protect that volume as credential-bearing data.

### Docker Compose

The repository ships a [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) that runs this published image.
From a checkout, export the secrets shown above and start it:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To build from source instead of pulling, add the build overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
```

## Verify

Check the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

The expected response is:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

## How Images Are Published

Images are built and pushed automatically, so the tags above stay current: every push to `main`
updates `tip` and adds the `<short-sha>` tag, and every published release adds `latest` and the
release version. Each tag is a multi-arch manifest built natively for `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64`. The build is defined in
[`.github/workflows/publish-docker.yml`](../.github/workflows/publish-docker.yml).
